### Super Splinter Cell is a reinvention of the well known stealth saga *Splinter Cell*, adapting the main mechanics from 3D to 2D (simulating a 16 bit's style), making a 3rd person shooter game become a zenithal view type game, changing the gameplay. In order to stay loyal to the original saga, the player will enbody Sam Fisher and will be able to use some of his most well known tools and weapons.
